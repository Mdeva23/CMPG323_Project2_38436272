CMPG 323 Project 2 - 38436272
Project Overview
NWU Tech Trends requires a solution to track the time and cost savings generated by automations developed by their team. This project involves creating a RESTful API that connects to a SQL Server database to store and manage telemetry data associated with these automations. The API will support CRUD operations for telemetry data and will include functionality to calculate cumulative time and cost savings per project and client.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the project, ensure that you have the following:

-Access to the NWU Azure tenant (login via the Azure Portal using your MS Fed account).
-A resource group created on Azure with an appropriate naming convention.
-Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition installed.
-.NET 8 SDK installed.
-Access to your GitHub repository.

Project Setup
Clone the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Mdeva23/CMPG-323-Project-2---38436272.git

Create the API Project

Open Visual Studio 2022.
Create a new .NET 8 Web API project in the cloned repository folder.

Database Configuration

Create a SQL Server database named CMPG323DB.
Run the provided SQL script to set up the necessary tables in the database.
Update the appsettings.json file with your database connection string:

API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints for managing telemetry data:

Telemetry Management
GET /api/telemetry

Retrieves all telemetry entries from the database.
GET /api/telemetry/{id}

Retrieves a specific telemetry entry by ID.
POST /api/telemetry

Creates a new telemetry entry.
PATCH /api/telemetry/{id}

Updates an existing telemetry entry.
DELETE /api/telemetry/{id}

Deletes an existing telemetry entry.
Time and Cost Savings Calculation
GET /api/telemetry/savings/project/{projectId}

Retrieves cumulative time and cost savings for a specific project within a specified date range.
GET /api/telemetry/savings/client/{clientId}

Retrieves cumulative time and cost savings for a specific client within a specified date range.
Security
The API is secured using JWT authentication. The following configurations have been added to the appsettings.json file:

Protecting Endpoints
Authorization is applied to all endpoints to ensure only authenticated users can access the API. Ensure to pass the JWT token in the header when making API requests

Deployment
Create an API Service on Azure

-Use an F1 tier (free) service plan.
-Deploy the API to Azure ensuring it's secure and accessible.
-Configure GitHub Repository

Ensure your repository is private and regularly updated throughout the project.
Commit and push all changes to GitHub.
